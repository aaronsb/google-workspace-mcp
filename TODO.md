# Attachment System Refactor

## Completed
- Created AttachmentIndexService
  - Map-based storage using messageId + filename as key
  - Built-in size limit (256 entries)
  - Expiry handling (1 hour timeout)

- Created AttachmentResponseTransformer
  - Simplifies attachment info for AI (filename only)
  - Integrated into API layer

- Updated Services
  - Gmail attachment handling now uses simplified format
  - Calendar attachment handling now uses simplified format

- Added Cleanup System
  - Created AttachmentCleanupService
  - Cleanup triggers on:
    - Index reaching size limit
    - Retrieving expired attachments

## Implementation Complete ✓

### Core Components
✓ AttachmentIndexService
  - Map-based storage with messageId + filename keys
  - Size limit (256 entries) with cleanup
  - Expiry handling (1 hour timeout)

### Cleanup System
✓ Adaptive Cleanup Implementation
  - Dynamic scheduling (5min-1hr intervals)
  - Activity-based adjustments
  - Performance monitoring
  - Immediate cleanup at 90% capacity

### Response Transformation
✓ AttachmentResponseTransformer
  - Unified handling for email and calendar attachments
  - Preserves full metadata internally
  - Exposes only filename to AI
  - Recursive transformation for nested objects

### Testing Coverage
✓ Comprehensive Test Suite
  - Core functionality verification
  - Integration between components
  - Expiry and size limit handling
  - Cleanup service behavior
  - Response transformation accuracy

### Ready for Use
The attachment system is now fully implemented and tested:
- Works with both Gmail and Calendar attachments
- Handles attachment metadata efficiently
- Maintains clean abstraction for AI interactions
- Includes performance-optimized cleanup

## Example Transformation
Before:
```json
{
  "id": "1952a804b3a15f6a",
  "attachments": [{
    "id": "ANGjdJ9gKpYkZ5NRp80mRJVCUe9XsAB93LHl22UrPU-9-pBPadGczuK3...",
    "name": "document.pdf",
    "mimeType": "application/pdf",
    "size": 1234
  }]
}
```

After:
```json
{
  "id": "1952a804b3a15f6a",
  "attachments": [{
    "name": "document.pdf"
  }]
}
